		<p>My name is Zhana Bishop and I'm a Senior at BHSVA.</p>
		<p>I like to read a lot. I've recently started reading again after finding free time to read. I don't have a specific genre I like to read, but I used to read a lot of young adult paranormal fiction, but they all seem the same now so I don't read them as much. I'm currently reading Looking for Alaska and I'm almost done with it. I could have finished it in a day but I have homework.</p>
		<p>I want to become successful in my career that is still undecided. I know I definitely want to go to college and have a high paying job because I'd like to travel a lot and just indulge a few times a year.</p>
